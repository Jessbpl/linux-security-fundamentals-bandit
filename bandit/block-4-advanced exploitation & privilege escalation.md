# Block 4 – Advanced Exploitation & Git Interaction
Levels: 25–33

## Overview

This block focuses on advanced SSH usage, restricted shells, SUID programs, and interacting with Git repositories over SSH. It teaches how to extract passwords from restricted environments and understand version control history.


## Level 25 → Level 26

### Objective:
Retrieve a password stored in a hidden file located inside a directory with restricted access.

### Context:
The password is stored in a file with unusual permissions inside a directory that is not listed by default commands. Proper enumeration is required.

### Commands Used:
```bash
# Copy SSH key from Bandit25 to Mac
cat ~/bandit26.sshkey > ~/bandit26.sshkey

# Set correct permissions
chmod 600 ~/bandit26.sshkey

# SSH into Bandit26 using the key
ssh -i ~/bandit26.sshkey bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

# Inside 'more', open vi and spawn a shell
:set shell=/bin/bash
:shell

# Retrieve password
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27
```

### Explanation:
The restricted shell prevents direct access to a normal prompt.
By shrinking the terminal and using more + vim, we spawn a real shell.
The SUID program bandit27-do is required for executing commands as bandit27.

### Security Concepts:
Restricted shell environments
SUID permissions
SSH key-based authentication

### Relevance to Cybersecurity:
Understanding restricted shells and SUID programs helps in privilege escalation analysis and penetration testing.


## Level 26 → Level 27

### Objective:
Use the SUID program bandit27-do to read the password for Bandit27.

### Context:
Direct access to the password file is not allowed for Bandit26. The SUID program runs as Bandit27, allowing you to execute commands with its privileges.

### Commands Used:
```bash
# Run the SUID program to read the next password
./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27

# SSH into Bandit27 using the retrieved password
ssh bandit27@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

### Explanation:
SUID programs allow executing commands with the file owner’s privileges.
bandit27-do lets Bandit26 execute cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27 as Bandit27, bypassing normal restrictions.

### Security Concepts:
SUID permission usage
Privilege escalation
File ownership and access control

### Relevance to Cybersecurity:
Understanding SUID and privilege escalation is critical for auditing permissions and detecting potential security risks.


##Level 27 → Level 28

### Objective:
Retrieve a password for Bandit28 from a Git repository via SSH.

### Context:
The password is stored in a Git repository on the Bandit27 server. It must be cloned and inspected locally.

### Commands Used:
```bash
# From Mac terminal, clone the repository
git clone ssh://bandit27-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:2220/home/bandit27-git/repo

# Enter the cloned folder
cd repo

# Read the password
cat README

# SSH into Bandit28 using the retrieved password
ssh bandit28@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

### Explanation:
Git over SSH allows secure repository access.
The password file (README) contains the next level’s password.
This emphasizes interacting with Git remotely rather than on the server.

### Security Concepts:
Git repository access over SSH
Version control security
Remote authentication

### Relevance to Cybersecurity:
Multiple layers of compression or encoding are common in malware delivery or exfiltration. Analysts must know how to extract and analyze content.


## Level 28 → Level 29

### Objective:
Access a password stored in a service requiring port scanning and network communication.

### Context:
The repository has been modified to hide the password in the latest commit. You need to examine older commits to find the original password.

### Commands Used:
```bash
# Check Git commit history
git log

# Show previous version of README containing the password
git show <commitID>:README.md

# SSH into Bandit29 using the retrieved password
ssh bandit29@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

### Explanation:
Git keeps a complete history of commits; even if the latest file hides the password, older commits retain it.
Viewing previous commits allows retrieval of hidden or overwritten data.

### Security Concepts:
Git history and version control integrity
Forensic recovery from versioned files
SSH-based repository access

### Relevance to Cybersecurity:
Understanding how to recover data from version control systems is critical during security audits and incident response.
