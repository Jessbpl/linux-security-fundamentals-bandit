# Block 4 – Advanced Exploitation & Privilege Escalation
Levels: 25–33

## Overview

This block focuses on advanced exploitation techniques, chaining commands, privilege escalation, and handling unusual system interactions.
It builds skills for identifying hidden credentials, exploiting misconfigurations, and preparing for real-world post-exploitation scenarios.


## Level 25 → Level 26

### Objective:
Retrieve a password stored in a hidden file located inside a directory with restricted access.

### Context:
The password is stored in a file with unusual permissions inside a directory that is not listed by default commands. Proper enumeration is required.

### Commands Used:
```bash
ls -la /hidden
cat /hidden/.password
```

### Explanation:
ls -la lists all files including hidden ones and shows permissions. cat outputs the content of the hidden file containing the password.

### Security Concepts:
Hidden files
Directory permissions

### Relevance to Cybersecurity:
Hidden files may contain credentials or configuration data. Learning to enumerate safely is crucial for penetration testing.


## Level 26 → Level 27

### Objective:
Decrypt a file encoded multiple times using different encoding schemes.

### Context:
The password is encoded using Base64 and then ROT13. Multiple commands must be combined to decode it correctly.

### Commands Used:
```bash
cat data.txt | base64 -d | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
```

### Explanation:
First, base64 -d decodes Base64. Then tr applies ROT13 to reverse the text obfuscation, revealing the password.

### Security Concepts:
Data obfuscation
Encoding vs encryption

### Relevance to Cybersecurity:
Analysts often encounter obfuscated or encoded data in logs, malware, or exfiltrated files. Understanding decoding chains is essential.


##Level 27 → Level 28

### Objective:
Retrieve a password from a file inside a compressed archive.

### Context:
The password is hidden inside multiple compressed formats that need to be extracted sequentially.

### Commands Used:
```bash
tar -xvf data.tar
gzip -d data.gz
cat data.txt
```

### Explanation:
The archive is first extracted with tar. Then gzip -d decompresses the file. Finally, cat reads the file containing the password.

### Security Concepts:
File extraction
Compression formats

### Relevance to Cybersecurity:
Multiple layers of compression or encoding are common in malware delivery or exfiltration. Analysts must know how to extract and analyze content.


## Level 28 → Level 29

### Objective:
Access a password stored in a service requiring port scanning and network communication.

### Context:
The password is returned by a service running on a local port. The correct port must be discovered before connecting.

### Commands Used:
```bash
nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost
nc localhost <PORT>
```

### Explanation:
nmap scans the local host for open ports in the given range. nc (netcat) connects to the identified service port to retrieve the password.

### Security Concepts:
Network scanning
Local service interaction

### Relevance to Cybersecurity:
Scanning for open ports and interacting with services is a core penetration testing and incident response skill.
