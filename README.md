# linux-security-fundamentals-bandit wargame 

This repo contains my documented walkthrough of the OverTheWire Bandit wargame, focusing on Linux fundamentals and security concepts relevant to SOC and cloud security covering:

- Command-line fundamentals
- File and directory handling
- File permissions and ownership
- SSH authentication
- Data inspection and recovery
- Git forensics, repository exploitation, and server validation
- Escaping restricted shell environments

---

## Blocks Overview

### Block 1 — Linux Basics & File Handling (Levels 0-7)
- Learn core Linux commands: `ls`, `cat`, `find`, `file`
- Explore hidden files, file types, and ownership
- Introduction to file searching, reading, and basic security insights

### Block 2 — File Inspection & Filtering (Levels 8-16)
- Data filtering using `sort`, `uniq`, `grep`
- Encoding and decoding (`base64`, ROT13)
- Binary inspection (`strings`)
- File decompression and multi-layer extraction

### Block 3 — SSH & Service Interaction (Levels 17-28)
- SSH key usage and permissions
- Networking basics using `nc` and specific ports
- Git repository interaction (cloning, history inspection)
- Service validation and error redirection

### Block 4 — Advanced Git Exploitation & Shell Escapes (Levels 29-33)
- Git forensics: inspect commits, blobs, and tags to recover secrets
- Bypassing `.gitignore` and pushing files to remote repositories
- Escaping restricted shells (Uppercase shell, `$0`)
- Real-world implications: CI/CD validation, restricted environment bypass
